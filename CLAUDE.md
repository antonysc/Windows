# Claude Code instructions

@AGENTS.md

Claude Code MUST treat every rule imported from `AGENTS.md` as mandatory and apply it exactly as ChatGPT/Codex does. Nested `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` files may add stricter directory-specific rules but may not weaken the root contract.

## Canonical application mapping

- Azure already exists in the project mapping as the `azure` sub-pod of
  `antonysc/Windows`; it is not a standalone repository.
- Before any repository creation or reorganization, read `AGENTS.md`,
  `PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md`, the README, and available catalogues. If a requested
  application is already mapped, explain the mapping and do not create a
  duplicate top-level repository unless the owner explicitly overrides it.
- Record user corrections in the durable mapping/evolution files before the
  related mutation so Claude and ChatGPT/Codex use the same current truth.

## Synchronous multi-agent coordination

Claude Code operates in the same live workstream as ChatGPT/Codex. Git and the repository's tracked coordination artifacts are the shared source of truth; chat context alone is never authoritative.

Before editing:

1. Synchronize and inspect the latest `main`.
2. Read the applicable agent instructions, project evolution, machine-readable project state, task ownership, and lock files when present.
3. Inspect current code, tests, history, and uncommitted or concurrent work before deciding what remains to do.

While working:

- Never assume exclusive repository or file ownership.
- Honor active task claims and locks; avoid duplicating work already completed or in progress.
- Keep the task bounded and changes separable from unrelated concurrent work.
- If `main` or an overlapping file changes, re-read the new state and reconcile both intentions without discarding either agent's work.
- Communicate durable state through tracked project/task/evolution artifacts required by `AGENTS.md`; do not rely on hidden session memory.

Before pushing:

1. Re-check `main` immediately before commit and integrate concurrent changes without force-pushing.
2. Run the relevant validations and review the final diff.
3. Produce one coherent commit per repository for the task, push directly to `main`, and leave an explicit handoff: completed, in progress, blocked, validation evidence, and the single next action.

# Claude Bootstrap — MAI Router V1

Treat the imported `AGENTS.md` rules as normative. Use the centralized MAI
Router V1 contract at `antonysc/Portfolio@main:mai/v1/MAI_CORE.md` and the
current repository's project profile before planning or editing.

- Route first, then resolve inside the selected scope.
- Activate only the minimum relevant domains and skills.
- Keep assumptions explicit and do not manufacture missing facts.
- Justify any limited scope expansion caused by a real dependency.
- Preserve repository-specific validation, update, safety, and commit rules.
- Produce concrete artifacts and exact validation evidence.

Do not fork a separate Claude-specific routing policy. All agent entry points
must converge on the same Portfolio / Workflow behavior.

Repository routing: `Windows` uses profile `provider_platforms` (revision `1.0.0`); canonical registry: `antonysc/Portfolio@main:mai/v1/PROJECT_SCOPE_REGISTRY.yaml`.

## Module catalog synchronization

Follow the replaceable-module contract in `AGENTS.md`. For every code change and commit, keep `module.yaml`, interface documentation, dependency/call metadata, implementation status, and contract tests synchronized with the implementation. Do not couple consumers to a provider-specific implementation, and never commit secret values.
